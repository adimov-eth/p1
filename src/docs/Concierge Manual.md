## Part 3: Core Operational Procedures

### 3.1 Workflow: Handling a Booking Request

This is our most critical procedure. Follow these steps without deviation.

1. **Step 1: Receive & Acknowledge** — Receive the request via any channel and immediately acknowledge using the appropriate script.
2. **Step 2: Gather Information (The "Big 5")** — Confirm the designated user's name, golf course and date, preferred tee time, number of players, and names of all guests.
3. **Step 3: Check Availability** — Consult the CRM for the member's remaining rounds. Contact the partner golf course to check tee time availability.
4. **Step 4: Confirm with Member** — Contact the member to confirm the exact tee time and clearly state the 48-hour cancellation policy.
5. **Step 5: Finalize & Communicate** — Send a formal confirmation via the LINE Mini-App, email a calendar invite, and update the member's usage in the CRM.

### 3.2 Procedure: Handling Cancellations

- **Outside 48 Hours:** Acknowledge the cancellation and update the booking system. No penalty.
- **Inside 48 Hours:**
  1. Politely inform the member that the cancellation is within the 48-hour window and will result in forfeiture of the rounds.
  2. Express empathy ("I understand last-minute changes happen...").
  3. If the member contests, do not argue. Escalate immediately to the Head Concierge.
  4. Document the interaction in the CRM.

### 3.3 Procedure: Complaint Resolution

1. **Listen:** Let the member explain the issue fully without interruption.
2. **Empathize & Apologize:** “I'm very sorry to hear you had that experience. That is not the standard we aim for.”
3. **Document:** Take detailed notes of the issue.
4. **Offer Immediate Action:** “I am going to investigate this immediately. I will call you back within the hour with an update.”
5. **Escalate:** Inform the Head Concierge of the situation.
6. **Follow Up:** Provide a resolution and follow up a few days later to ensure the member is satisfied.
