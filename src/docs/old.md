4. **Social & External Links:** Footer on most pages includes links to social media (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube) and a “Powered by MakeWebEasy.com” credit.
5. **E‑commerce:** Product page should include sorting options, product descriptions, price, and add‑to‑cart functionality.  Ensure compliance with user‑checkout flows and confirm before final purchase.
