# Prime Corporate Golf Club - Content Alignment Proposal

## Executive Summary

This document proposes specific updates to align `landing.html` and `spec.md` with the actual business model defined in `HTML_DRAFTS/` by investors and sales partners.

**Core Problem**: Current public-facing materials reflect speculative competitive analysis (฿700k, green-fee-only, Bangkok general market). Actual approved business model is ฿950k all-inclusive targeting EEC industrial executives.

**Recommendation**: Update landing.html and spec.md to match HTML_DRAFTS/ operational reality while preserving excellent design and structure.

---

## 1. Pricing Model Updates

### Current State (WRONG)
- **landing.html line 119-129**: ฿700,000 annual fee
- **spec.md**: ฿700,000 positioning vs Pacific Links Thailand
- **Model**: Green fee covered, cart/caddie paid separately at course
- **Rounds**: 150 annually

### Target State (CORRECT - from HTML_DRAFTS/)
- **Standard**: ฿950,000 annual (post-launch)
- **Founders' Circle**: ฿750,000 (10 spots, 156 rounds, ฿200k savings)
- **Early Adopter**: ฿850,000 (slots 11-25, ฿100k savings)
- **Model**: All-inclusive (green fee + caddy + cart)
- **Rounds**: 144 standard, 156 Founders

### Proposed Changes

#### landing.html - Hero Section (lines 85-110)

<div class="founders-urgency">
  <span class="badge">Founders' Circle: Only 10 Spots Available</span>
</div>
```

#### landing.html - Pricing Cards (lines 350-450)
Replace single ฿700k card with 3-tier structure:

- "Available Q2 2025"
- "Full member benefits"

#### landing.html - Value Proposition Section (lines 200-280)
```html
<!-- CURRENT -->
<h3>Transparent, All-In Pricing</h3>
<p>Your ฿700,000 annual fee covers green fees at 80+ courses...</p>
<p class="note">Cart and caddie fees paid directly at the course.</p>

<!-- PROPOSED -->
<h3>Truly All-Inclusive</h3>
<p>Your membership fee covers everything: green fee, caddy, and cart at 80+ premium courses.</p>
<p class="highlight">No surprises. No hidden costs. No checkout at the course.</p>
```

## 2. Target Market Repositioning

### Current State (WRONG)
- Generic "corporate decision-makers"
- Bangkok-first strategy
- No specific industry focus

### Target State (CORRECT - from HTML_DRAFTS/Target Company Outreach)
- **Primary**: EEC Industrial Corridor (Map Yang Phon/Rayong)
  - Automotive: AutoAlliance, GM, BMW, Mercedes-Benz
  - Petrochemical: PTT GC, SCG Chemicals, Covestro, Dow
  - Industrial Estates: WHA, Amata
  - Electronics: Western Digital, Seagate, Delta Electronics
- **Secondary**: Banks, law firms, consulting (Bangkok)

### Proposed Changes

#### landing.html - "Designed For" Section (new section after hero)
```html
<section class="ideal-clients bg-navy-light">
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Built for Thailand's Industrial Leaders</h2>
    <p class="subtitle">Trusted by executives at:</p>

    <div class="industry-grid">

      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="location-note">Headquartered in Map Yang Phon/Rayong EEC? We designed this membership for you.</p>
  </div>
</section>
```

#### spec.md - Market Positioning Updates
Replace generic Bangkok corporate messaging with:
- "EEC industrial executives spend 60+ minutes commuting between Map Yang Phon and Rayong courses"
- "Coordinating client golf outings currently requires managing multiple course memberships, varying policies, and unpredictable availability"
- "Prime consolidates 80+ premium courses with single concierge contact and LINE Mini-App booking"

## 11. Open Questions for Adimov

**Founders' Circle Countdown:**
- How many spots have actually been sold? (For "X of 10 remaining" messaging)
- Is there a hard deadline (e.g., March 31, 2025) or just "first 10 members"?

**LINE Mini-App:**
- Are there screenshots/mockups available, or should I create wireframes for visualization?
- Is the Mini-App already built, or is this roadmap feature?

**Course Photography:**
- Do we have licensed photos of the top 10 flagship courses, or should we use placeholders?

**Testimonials:**
- Are there any founding members or pilot users willing to provide quotes/photos?
- Any corporate logos we're authorized to display ("Trusted by...")?

**Launch Timeline:**
- What's the target go-live date for updated landing.html?
- Is this a public site or only shown to investor/sales prospects?

**Brief.md Status:**
- Should brief.md be archived/deleted, or updated to match new positioning?
- Was the PLT competitive analysis useful, or should we focus on different competitors?

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this proposal** - Confirm alignment with investor/sales partner expectations
2. **Answer open questions** - Provide missing details (countdown, photos, timeline)
3. **Approve phase 1 changes** - Authorize critical pricing/coverage updates
4. **Provide assets** - LINE Mini-App mockups, course photos, testimonials (if available)
5. **Implementation** - I'll execute approved changes to landing.html and spec.md

Once approved, I can implement changes incrementally (phase by phase) or all at once depending on your preference.
