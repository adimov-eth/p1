## Success Criteria

**Primary:**
- ✅ Single source of truth (`prime.ts`) drives all pages
- ✅ No data inconsistencies across 18+ documents
- ✅ Landing page sells Founders' Circle (urgency, benefits, LINE Mini-App)
- ✅ Sales team can show unified vision to investors

**Secondary:**
- ✅ Easy to update pricing/policies (change once in prime.ts)
- ✅ Clean component architecture (reusable across pages)
- ✅ Fast development velocity (Astro productivity)
- ✅ Professional quality matching HTML_DRAFTS/ design

**Bonus:**
- ✅ Interactive elements where valuable (checklists, UAT tracker)
- ✅ Delightful details (smooth transitions, micro-interactions)
- ✅ Production-ready deploy (Cloudflare Pages, < 1 min build)

## Notes

- Prioritize content accuracy over fancy features
- Extract reusable components early (PricingCard, CourseCard)
- Test data flow from `prime.ts` → components → pages frequently
- Keep designs matching HTML_DRAFTS/ aesthetic (don't redesign)
- Use Svelte islands sparingly (only where interactivity adds value)
- Deploy preview early to catch issues in production build

---

**Time estimate:** 4-5 full days of focused work
**Tools:** Astro, TypeScript, Svelte (islands), Tailwind CSS
**Deploy:** Cloudflare Pages or Netlify
**Domain:** primethailand.golf (when ready)
