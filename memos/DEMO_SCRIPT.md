## Script

### Opening (10 seconds)

"Prime is a corporate golf membership platform designed for the Thai market. We're targeting ฿949k annual subscriptions from corporations who want to offer golf access to executives without the multi-million baht upfront cost of traditional memberships."

"Let me show you how the system works from booking request to course check-in."

---

### Scene 1: Concierge Dashboard (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Console Dashboard showing 2 pending requests]**

"This is the concierge console. We currently have 2 booking requests pending."

**[Point to SLA metrics]**

"Operations dashboard tracks service level: 12-minute average response time, 98% fulfillment rate, 4.8 out of 5 member satisfaction."

"Our model works because we handle the complexity - members just message us their preferences, and we coordinate everything."

---

### Scene 2: Create Booking (60 seconds)

**[Click "Create Booking" on John Smith's request]**

"John Smith requested Alpine Golf Club for Saturday morning, 2 players. Watch what happens when the concierge processes this."

**[Form loads with pre-filled data]**

"The system pre-fills everything from the request context:
- Organization: Acme Corporation
- Member: John Smith
- Players: 2
- Date: Tomorrow (Saturday)
- Tee time: 9 AM"

**[Point to rounds calculation]**

"Rounds calculation is transparent:
- Current: 143 rounds remaining
- This booking uses: 2 rounds
- After confirmation: 141 rounds"

**[Select "Alpine Golf Club" from dropdown]**

"Concierge just selects the course..."

**[Click "Confirm Booking"]**

"...and confirms."

**[Button shows "Creating..." then redirects to dashboard]**

"Notice the request queue updated immediately - we're down to 1 pending request. The booking is now live."

---

### Scene 3: Member App (60 seconds)

**[Navigate to /app]**

"This is what John sees on his phone - the LINE Mini-App."

**[Point to rounds counter]**

"His rounds balance updated in real-time: 141 rounds remaining. No refresh needed - the system uses observable state management."

**[Point to next booking card]**

"He can see his upcoming booking: Alpine Golf Club, Thursday October 30th, 9 AM, 2 players."

**[Click "Digital Card"]**

"When he arrives at the course, he opens his digital membership card..."

---

### Scene 4: Check-in (45 seconds)

**[Screen: Digital Card with QR code]**

"The course staff scans this QR code to verify his membership. For demo purposes, we'll simulate the check-in."

**[Click "Simulate Check-in"]**

"Button shows loading state while the system processes..."

**[Wait for completion, navigate back to home]**

"And now watch what happens to his rounds balance."

**[Point to updated numbers]**

"Rounds automatically decremented: 141 to 139. The system tracked that he used 2 rounds for this booking."

"This is the core value proposition: usage tracking is automatic, transparent, and auditable. No spreadsheets, no manual reconciliation."

---

### Scene 5: Analytics (45 seconds)

**[Navigate to Console → Analytics]**

"For corporate clients and our operations team, we provide real-time analytics."

**[Point to key metrics]**

"Total bookings: 4
Confirmation rate: 50%
Active members: 2
Most popular course: Alpine Golf Club - 75% of bookings"

"This data helps us:
- Negotiate better rates with popular courses
- Identify usage patterns for upselling
- Monitor service quality across partners"

---

### Scene 6: Statements (30 seconds)

**[Navigate to Statements]**

"At the end of each month, courses send us billing statements."

**[Point to October 2025 statement]**

"Concierge verifies the bill against actual check-in records before we process payment."

"Full audit trail for financial reconciliation - important for corporate clients who need transparency for their finance teams."

---

### Closing (20 seconds)

"So that's the complete flow: member requests booking via LINE chat, concierge confirms within minutes, member checks in with QR code, usage tracked automatically, monthly reconciliation with course partners."

"The system is production-ready. What we've shown today is real code - it works end-to-end with automatic state updates, error handling, and mobile-responsive design."

"Questions?"

---

## Backup Talking Points (If Asked)

**"How do you make money?"**

"฿949k annual subscription from corporations. At 150 rounds per year, that's ฿6,327 per round - significantly cheaper than pay-per-play at premium courses which can be ฿10-15k. Margins come from volume negotiations with course partners."

**"What's your tech stack?"**

"Astro static generation with React islands for interactivity. Scales to millions of users without complex backend. When we go to production, we'll add Cloudflare Workers for API, Postgres for data, LINE LIFF for authentication."

**"Why demo with mocks instead of real backend?"**

"This is a product validation demo - we wanted to show the UX and member journey before building production infrastructure. The architecture is already designed - we can ship production in 4-6 weeks if we have funding."

**"What about fraud prevention?"**

"QR codes are member-specific and time-bound. Course staff scans at check-in, system validates in real-time. Any discrepancies trigger alerts for concierge review. Full audit trail in statements."

**"How do you handle cancellations?"**

"48-hour cancellation window - cancel before that, rounds restored. Cancel within 48 hours or no-show, rounds forfeited. This matches traditional golf club policies."

**"What about scalability?"**

"Current architecture: Cloudflare edge deployment, serves static assets globally, API endpoints scale automatically. Database: Postgres with read replicas. We can handle 10,000 members Day 1 with this stack."
