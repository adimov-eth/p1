# Demo Walkthrough - Oct 29, 2025

**Actual manual testing of flows as if presenting to investor.**

---

## Flow 1: Console → Create Booking from Request

**Path:** /console → Click "Create Booking" on John Smith's request

**What worked smoothly:**
- Form pre-fills correctly from request context:
  - Organization: Acme Corporation (auto-selected)
  - Primary Member: John Smith (auto-selected)
  - Players: 2 (matches request "2 players")
  - Date: tomorrow (reasonable default for "Saturday")
  - Tee Time: 09:00 AM (reasonable for "morning")
- Rounds calculation visible and clear:
  - Current: 143 rounds
  - Using: -2 rounds
  - After booking: 141 rounds
  - ✓ Sufficient rounds available
- Golf course selection: clean dropdown with 2 options
- Button loading state: "Confirm Booking" → "Creating..." (disabled)
- Auto-redirect to dashboard after success
- Pending requests count: 2 → 1 (John's request processed, only Jane remains)
- **No refresh needed** - mockState.notify() updated UI automatically

**Observation:** Form UX is excellent for concierge workflow. Pre-filling from request saves time.

## Flow 2: App → Check-in

**Path:** /app → Digital Card → Simulate Check-in → Back to Home

**What worked smoothly:**
- Digital card loads member info (John Smith, Acme Corporation, USER_001)
- QR code visible (placeholder image, but styled correctly)
- Check-in button clear: "Simulate Check-in"
- Loading state: button shows "Loading..." while mutation processes
- Returns to card page after check-in completes
- Home page verification:
  - Rounds: 141 → 139 (decremented by 2)
  - Rounds Used: 3 → 5 (incremented by 2)
  - Last Played: updated to Oct 30
  - **No refresh needed** - state updated automatically

**Observation:** Check-in flow is dead simple. Member just taps button, rounds decrement immediately visible on home.

## Flow 3: Navigation Testing

**Console sidebar navigation:**
- ✅ Dashboard → Bookings: works
- ✅ Bookings → Members: works
- ✅ Members → Statements: works
- ✅ Statements → Analytics: works
- ✅ Analytics → Dashboard: works

**App navigation:**
- ✅ Home → Digital Card: works
- ✅ Digital Card → Back to Home: works
- ✅ Home → My Bookings: works
- ✅ My Bookings → Back to Home: works
- ✅ Bookings tabs: Upcoming ↔ Past works

**What didn't work:**
- ❌ Direct URL navigation (e.g., /console/bookings) → 404
  - React Router handles client-side routing
  - Must navigate via /console then use sidebar
  - Not blocking for demo (investor won't type URLs)

---

## Flow 4: Console Pages Review

**Manage Bookings:**
- Table shows 4 bookings including newly created one (BOOKING_1761729181686)
- Stats update correctly: 2 confirmed, 2 completed
- Search box present (functional based on code review)

**Member Profiles:**
- Shows 2 members (John Smith, Jane Doe)
- Stats: 2 total, 2 active, 1 admin, 1 designated
- Empty state tested: search "nonexistent" → "No members found - Try adjusting your search query"
- Count shows "0 of 2" (indicates filtering, not truly empty)

**Analytics:**
- Metrics computed from mockState:
  - Total Bookings: 4
  - Confirmation Rate: 50%
  - Active Members: 2
  - Avg Players/Booking: 1.5
  - Most Popular Course: Alpine Golf Club (3 bookings, 75%)
- SLA metrics: 12 min response, 98% fulfillment, 4.8/5.0 satisfaction

**Statements:**
- 1 statement (STMT_001 - October 2025, Alpine Golf Club)
- Status: "sent" (pending review)
- Action buttons: View, Verify

## What Worked Smoothly (Demo-Ready)

1. **State management**: mockState.notify() auto-updates UI without refresh
2. **Form pre-filling**: Request context → booking form (saves concierge time)
3. **Loading states**: Buttons show "Creating..." / "Loading..." during mutations
4. **Rounds tracking**: Visible calculation before/after, immediate updates post-check-in
5. **Empty states**: Search-aware messaging ("No members found" vs "No bookings yet")
6. **Navigation**: Sidebar buttons work consistently
7. **Tabs**: Bookings Upcoming/Past switch smoothly
8. **Animations**: Polish verified in previous session (hover effects, transitions)

---

## What Felt Clunky (Non-Blocking)

1. **Quick action cards on dashboard**: Clicked "Manage Bookings" button → nothing happened
   - Had to use sidebar "Bookings" button instead
   - Not blocking: investors won't notice if we use sidebar navigation during demo

2. **Direct URL navigation**: /console/bookings → 404
   - Astro vs React Router architecture issue
   - Not blocking: demo script will use in-app navigation only

3. **React Router navigation delay**: ~1 second wait after clicking nav buttons
   - Pages eventually load correctly
   - Not blocking: acceptable for demo, would optimize for production

---

## Error States Verified

1. **Search empty state**: Typing "nonexistent" in Members search
   - Result: "No members found - Try adjusting your search query"
   - Count shows "0 of 2" (correctly indicates filtering)

2. **Loading states**: Button disabled during mutations
   - "Confirm Booking" → "Creating..."
   - "Simulate Check-in" → "Loading..."
   - Prevents double-submission

## Next Steps

1. **Rehearse demo script** (30 min)
