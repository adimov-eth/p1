**The Core Insight:**

Prime's product is **removing friction from corporate golf**. The UX should feel like having a personal assistant, not using software. The backoffice should make one concierge feel like ten through automation and perfect information.

Customer sees: Effortless.
Concierge sees: Efficient.
System does: Everything automated that can be.
