# Financial Operations SOP

Standard operating procedures for invoicing, payments, and settlements.

## Corporate Invoicing Workflow

2. **Create & Detail Invoice** — Generate an invoice in the accounting software with all required legal details, the membership item, amount plus VAT, and a Net 30 due date. _(System: Accounting Software)_
3. **Send Invoice** — Email the invoice as a PDF with a payment link directly from the accounting software. _(System: Accounting Software)_
4. **Update Status & Set Reminders** — Update the client's CRM record to “Invoiced – Awaiting Payment” and configure automated payment reminders. _(System: CRM & Accounting)_

## Payment Tracking & Activation

## Partner Course Settlement Workflow

3. **Verify with Partner** — Email the statement to each course's accounts department for verification to prevent disputes. Allow 3–5 business days. _(System: Email)_
