 My Approach (full doc in DEVELOPMENT_APPROACH.md)

  Both reviews had good ideas but wrong priorities:

  Claude Web:
  - Good: Identified design systems, component thinking
  - Wrong: Proposed full member portal/dashboard/booking system for pre-launch with 0 members

  ChatGPT:
  - Good: Single source of truth, consistency audit, SSG suggestions
  - Critical error: Assumed brief.md (700k) was source of truth, built entire migration plan BACKWARDS
    - Would update HTML_DRAFTS/ operational docs to match speculative competitive analysis
    - Would overwrite investor-approved 950k with 700k
    - Would remove Founders' Circle tier sales team is actively selling

  What I just did (30 min ago):
  - Phase 1: Fixed landing.html business model mismatch
  - 950k pricing, 144 rounds, all-inclusive messaging
  - 17 "all-inclusive" instances, updated FAQ/policies/testimonials

  What I'd do next:

  Phase 2 (2-3 hours) - Content completion:
  1. Add Founders' Circle urgency section (only 10 spots, 200k savings, exclusive benefits)
  2. LINE Mini-App showcase (NFC card, booking, tracking - real differentiator from HTML_DRAFTS/)
  3. Top 10 flagship courses (from Member Welcome Package)
  4. Optional: EEC industrial messaging (if landing is targeted vs broadly public)

  Phase 3 (1 hour, optional) - Simple data centralization:
  const PRIME_DATA = {
    membership: {
      standard: { price: 950_000, rounds: 144 },
      founders: { price: 750_000, rounds: 156, slots: 10 }
    },
    // ...
  };
  Single source of truth without framework overhead.

  What NOT to build:
  - ❌ Astro/Eleventy migration (1 page doesn't need SSG)
  - ❌ Member dashboard (0 members)
  - ❌ Booking system (concierge handles it manually - prove that works first)
  - ❌ Authentication (nothing to gate)
  - ❌ Component library (YAGNI)

  Why:
  - HTML_DRAFTS/ serve different purpose (investor/sales docs, not website pages)
  - They're already correct and being used successfully
  - Don't build infrastructure before pain demands it
  - Focus on what gets you to launch: compelling landing page that sells Founders' Circle

  The question that matters:
  Does landing.html sell 10 Founders' Circle memberships to EEC executives?

  Everything else is theater.

  Want me to continue with Phase 2 (Founders urgency + LINE Mini-App + flagship courses)? Or different direction?
