# Spec Index

This folder holds living specs for Prime. Start with the PRD to align scope, then use the View Inventory to drive shadcn UI work and routes.

- PRD: goals, scope, acceptance criteria — see `spec/PRD.md`.
- View Inventory (shadcn): screen specs, routes, components — see `spec/Views.md`.

Workflow
- Update PRD first when scope changes; keep it stable.
- Iterate views/components in small PRs; link sections edited.
- Capture open questions in PRD; resolve before implementation.

Ownership
- Product: PRD authority.
- Engineering: View specs, feasibility notes.
- Design: Components, tokens, interactions.
