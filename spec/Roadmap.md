# Roadmap

## MVP (v1.0)
- LIFF: Home, Digital Card (NFC/QR), Bookings list + detail, Invite Guest.
- Concierge Console: Dashboard, Booking create/edit, Member profile, Courses.
- Partner Portal: Statements list + detail, verify/flag.
- Webhooks: e‑sign status, invoice status → activation.
- Policies: 144 rounds, 48h cancellation, user transfer fee logging.
- SLAs: concierge ACK/resolve tracking; basic dashboards/logs.

## v1.1 (Stabilize & Scale)
- Concierge templates (email/LINE), calendar invite automation.
- Usage discrepancy tooling and reconciliation assist.
- Statement batch generation + export.
- Multi‑language content (EN/TH) for LIFF basics.

## v1.2 (Efficiency & Insight)
- Light self‑serve intent capture (member proposes date/time/preferences; concierge confirms).
- Partner tee‑time verification API with pilot courses.
- Advanced analytics dashboard; cohort usage insights for renewal playbooks.

## Later
- Payments & invoicing integration (Xero/Stripe) end‑to‑end.
- Multi‑currency; regional expansion.
- Full self‑serve booking for select courses under policy guardrails.

Assumptions and priorities to be revisited after Founders’ cohort feedback.
