# Product Vision — Prime Corporate Golf Club

## Mission
Enable executives to host high‑impact business golf effortlessly. Prime combines a concierge‑first service, a curated partner network, and a lightweight digital experience (LINE Mini‑App) to deliver a premium, reliable, and discreet corporate golf membership.

## The Problem
- Booking and managing top‑tier courses is time‑consuming and inconsistent.
- Companies lack unified quotas, usage transparency, and guest coordination.
- The “premium” experience breaks across channels: emails, spreadsheets, course desks.

## Our Solution
- Concierge‑managed bookings backed by clear SLAs and playbooks.
- A mobile‑first LIFF Mini‑App for digital card, check‑in (NFC/QR), usage, and guest invites.
- Transparent quotas (144 rounds/year) and policies codified in product logic.
- Partner network operations: monthly statements, verification, and payouts.

## Target Customers & Segments
- Mid‑to‑large corporations in Thailand (regional expansion later) with executive entertainment budgets.
- Primary personas: C‑level, Sales/BD leaders, and their executive assistants.

## Value Proposition
- Time back: concierge handles everything within SLA.
- Consistency: predictable access to top courses with clear policies.
- Transparency: quota, usage, and statements without back‑and‑forth.
- Discretion and trust: PDPA‑aware, secure handling of personal and guest data.

## Differentiators
- Concierge‑first experience with documented SOPs and service quality metrics.
- Seamless check‑in via NFC/QR; guest invites through LINE share.
- Partner‑friendly settlement and verification process.
- Simple, enforceable rules (48‑hour cancellation, user transfer fee) embedded across flows.

## Success Metrics (v1)
- 10–25 founding members onboarded; time‑to‑activation < 7 days.
- ≥ 95% of check‑ins completed without concierge escalation.
- Concierge SLA compliance ≥ 95% (ACK and resolution windows).
- Zero unresolved quota discrepancies per billing cycle.

## Product Principles
- Keep it simple: few screens, focused interactions.
- Service over software: tech amplifies a human‑led premium experience.
- Fast and reliable: mobile p95 < 2.5s; API p95 < 300ms in‑region.
- Privacy by design: minimal data, clear retention, auditable actions.

## Scope Guardrails (MVP)
- No self‑serve booking engine; concierge creates bookings.
- Payments out of scope; invoice and webhook stubs accepted.
- Single language (EN) unless partner or member mandates localized content.
