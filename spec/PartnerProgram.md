# Partner Program

## Objectives
- Reliable access for members; predictable settlement and low dispute rate for partners.

## Onboarding
- Capture course profile: contacts, policies (blackouts, group sizes), preferred comms.
- Add payout details and statement contact.
- Agree to monthly verification window (3–5 business days).

## Operations
- Concierge logs all rounds with course, date, players.
- Monthly: generate statement per course; send for verification.
- Resolve disputes with supporting booking/usage records; adjust statements as needed.
- Contact channels today: phone, LINE message, and email (no partner APIs initially).

## SLAs (Partner‑facing)
- Statement dispatch: by the 1st of each month.
- Verification window: 3–5 business days.
- Payment: within agreed terms after verification.

## Initial Partner List (pilot focus)
- Alpine Golf Club — manual contact via phone/LINE/email.
- Nikanti Golf Club — manual contact via phone/LINE/email.
- Siam Country Club — manual contact via phone/LINE/email.

## Future Integrations
- Tee‑time verification API pilots with select partners (medium‑term).
- Optional webhook for partner confirmations.
- Explore a separate SaaS (“TeeTime Bridge”) to aggregate course comms across phone/LINE/email with structured workflows and SLAs.
